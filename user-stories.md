<h1>User Stories</h1>

<h2>1. The Developer</h2>

As the developer, my role is to create an app that calculates the number of times different users click on certain pictures. I have to account for user experience and ensure my code is idiot-proof and accurately keeps track of the number of clicks. Once all the data has been collected, I will provide that data to the marketing company, who will pass on that information to their client at Bus Mall. Bus Mall will make the decision on what items to showcase in their catalogue based off the data collected.

<h2>2. The Marketing Team</h2>

The marketing team's function is to decide which images to print in the catalogue. They will make these decisions based off the data provided from the developer's Web app. They will likely base this decision on the most clicks a certain picture has collected after being viewed by several different user.

<h2>3. The Focus Group Participant</h2>

The focus group participant probably wants to make a quick buck off an easy exercise. They need a user-friendly web app to use so they can click through the photos fluidly. Instructions must be clear to the participant so they have no trouble getting through the app. The time required should not take them more than 10-20 minutes.
